- 👋 Hi, I’m @josiahayres
- 👀 I’m interested in FrontEnd Development (React, Vue, Solid), Design Systems (Design Tokens) and structure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Websockets and .NET API development.
- 🤔 My GitHub contributions graph seems empty, as most of my dev work is done using enterprise & client GitHub accounts.

## Projects I've Built:

### Clocktime:
Inspired by a clock I once saw (credit unknown).

Designed to work with my [MacOS screensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).

View the clock running [here](https://josiahayres.github.io/clocktime/).
